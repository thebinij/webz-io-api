## Data Ingestion Service - Design Document

### 1. Overview

The Data Ingestion Service is a system designed to retrieve data from various sources, process it, and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The service will be implemented to ensure scalability, maintainability, and portability. Docker will be used to containerize the system for deployment in different environments.

### 2. System Requirements

The system will meet the following requirements:

- **Data Retrieval**: The service must be capable of retrieving data from configurable sources via API configuration settings. It should adapt to different data sources by adjusting the retrieval logic according to the specified configuration, including handling pagination and rate limiting where necessary.
- **Data Processing**: The retrieved data will be processed to match the required format for storage in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Storage**: The processed data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy querying and analysis.

### 3. System Architecture

The architecture consists of two primary components:

- **DataIngestionService**: The core component that manages the entire data ingestion process. This service is responsible for making requests to the data sources, processing the retrieved data, and storing the processed data in the database. The `DataIngestionService` communicates with the `RestApiBuilder` to interact with external data sources and retrieves the necessary data.
  
- **PostgresClient**: This component is responsible for saving the processed data into the PostgreSQL database.

The components communicate with each other via well-defined interfaces, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

### 4. Data Flow

The data flow within the system is as follows:

1. **Data Retrieval**: The `DataIngestionService` triggers the API call via `RestApiBuilder` to interact with the appropriate data source(s). The `DataIngestionService` constructs query strings, headers, and request bodies based on the provided configuration and payload, then passes the request to `RestApiBuilder` to execute it.
  
2. **Data Processing**: After the data is retrieved, the `DataIngestionService` processes the data to ensure it is in the required format for insertion into the database. This step includes any necessary transformations or filtering.

3. **Data Storage**: Once processed, the data is passed to the `PostgresClient`, which handles the insertion of the data into the PostgreSQL database.

This flow will be executed periodically, triggered by an external scheduler or event.

### 5. Database Design

TODO: The data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### 6. Error Handling and Retries

The system will include the following mechanisms to handle errors:

- **Rate Limiting**: The `RestApiBuilder` will handle rate-limiting by respecting the constraints of the data source and implementing backoff strategies in case the limits are reached.
- **Error Retries**: If a request fails (due to network issues or other transient errors), the system will automatically retry the request a predefined number of times. If the error persists, it will be logged for manual intervention.

### 7. Scalability and Performance

The system will be designed with scalability in mind. Key considerations include:

- **Pagination**: Data sources supporting pagination will be handled to ensure that the system can retrieve large datasets in manageable chunks.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Data retrieval and processing will be asynchronous, allowing for non-blocking operations and better resource utilization.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing and optimized queries will be used to ensure that the PostgreSQL database performs efficiently even as the dataset grows.

### 8. Deployment and Portability

The service will be containerized using Docker to ensure it can be deployed consistently across different environments. The Docker setup will include:

- A container for the Data Ingestion Service.
- A PostgreSQL container to handle data storage.

Environment variables will be used for configuration, such as database credentials and API keys, to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

### 9. Logging and Monitoring

The system will include logging for tracking important events and errors. Logs will be stored in a centralized logging system to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting. Key events to log include:

- Data retrieval attempts and results (success or failure).
- Data processing steps and any errors encountered.
- Database interactions, including insertions and errors.

### 10. Future Considerations

The design allows for future enhancements, including:

- **Filtering and Sorting**: Additional features may be added to filter and sort the data during processing, allowing for more refined data retrieval.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: In the future, a real-time data update mechanism (e.g., webhooks or polling) may be introduced to keep the data synchronized with the source.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Additional error handling strategies, such as circuit breakers or retries with exponential backoff, can be implemented to improve system resilience.
- **Rate Limiting**: As a future enhancement, the system may support more advanced rate-limiting strategies, potentially using external libraries or services for more fine-grained control.

### 11. Conclusion

This document outlines the design for the Data Ingestion Service, which will automate the process of fetching, processing, and storing data from configurable data sources into a PostgreSQL database. The service will be designed to be scalable, maintainable, and portable, with Docker providing a consistent environment for deployment. Error handling, logging, and monitoring will be integral parts of the system to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.
